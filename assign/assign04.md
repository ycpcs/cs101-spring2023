# Your Task

Your task for this assignment is to complete the following CloudCoder exercises.  We <em>strongly</em> recommend you do them in order.  The later exercises are (in general) more challenging than the earlier ones.

<b>Important</b>: Unlike the other assignments, this assignment is entirely individual.  You may <em>not</em> collaborate with or get help from other students.  You may ask an instructor or tutor for help.

## Hints

Don't print a prompt when reading input values.  CloudCoder does not require a prompt, and the text of the prompt is likely to be misinterpreted as the program's intended output, causing tests to fail.

Since all of the exercises involve structs, you will want to

1. Think about a general strategy for solving the problem, and write down an outline of your strategy including what the fields of the structs are
2. Consider whether parameters are *passed-by-value* (i.e. use the . to access fields) or *passed-by-reference* via a pointer (i.e. use the -> to access fields)
3. Consider the return type of the functions to ensure returning the appropriate type of value (if any).
