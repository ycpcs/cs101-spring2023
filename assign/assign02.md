---

**Due dates:**

* Milestone 1:
    * Design due: **Tuesday, Feb 28th** in class
    * Code due: **Saturday, Mar 04th** in class
* Milestone 2:
    * Design due: **Tuesday, Mar 07** in class
    * Code due: **Tuesday, Mar 14th** in class

Getting Started
===============

Start by downloading [CS101\_Assign02.zip](CS101_Assign02.zip), saving it in the **CS101** directory within your home directory.

Start a **Cygwin Bash Shell** (or Linux terminal, or MacOS terminal) and run the following commands:

    cd h:
    cd CS101
    unzip CS101_Assign02.zip
    cd CS101_Assign02

(Note that you should omit the `cd h:` step on Linux and MacOS.)

Using a text editor (e.g., Notepad++), open the file

> **CS101/CS101\_Assign02/MontyHall.cpp**

You will add your code to this file.

When you are ready to compile the program, in the Cygwin window (or terminal window) type the command

    make

To run the program, type the command

    ./MontyHall.exe

The Monty Hall Problem
======================

In this assignment, you will implement a simulation of the game show Let's Make A Deal. In particular, you will implement a simulation which allows the user to try out strategies for the [Monty Hall Problem](http://www.letsmakeadeal.com/problem.htm).

In the game, the contestant would be shown a stage with three closed doors:

-   Behind one of the doors was a valuable prize (the "car").
-   Behind two of the doors were less desirable prizes (the "goats").
-   The contestant would pick one of the three doors.
-   Monty Hall, the host of the show, would then reveal the prize behind another door (not the door the contestant picked initially), which was always a goat. (Note that even if the contestant happens to guess which door has the car right away, Monty will still reveal a goat behind a different door.)
-   Monty would then ask the contestant whether she wanted to switch her choice. Because Monty always revealed a goat, the contestant would need to decide whether her original door or the remaining unopened door was more likely to contain the car.

## Milestone 1

In **Milestone 1**, the first of two milestones, you will simulate a single "round" in which

-   the program randomly decides which door the car is behind, without revealing this information to the user
-   allows the user to pick a door
-   lets the player know which door Monty opened (which must not be the door the player picked, and which must contain a goat)
-   asks the user whether she wants to change her choice to the other unopened door
-   informs the user which prize she won (car or goat)

Here is an example run of the program (user input in **bold**):

<pre>
Which door would you like to pick? (1-3) <b>3</b>
Monty shows you a goat behind door number 2
Which door would you like to pick now? (1-3) <b>1</b>
You won the car!
</pre>

Another example run (user input in **bold**):

<pre>
Which door would you like to pick? (1-3) <b>2</b>
Monty shows you a goat behind door number 1
Which door would you like to pick now? (1-3) <b>3</b>
You got a goat, sorry. The car was behind door 2
</pre>

### Deliverables for Milestone 1

The [design artifact](../design-template.pdf) for Milestone 1 is due at the beginning class on **Tuesday, Feb 28th**.  Make sure that you fill out the "Strategy" and "Control flow sketch" sections of the design template.

The code for Milestone 1 should be submitted to Marmoset (using the command `make submit_ms1`) by the end of the day on **Saturday, Mar 04th**.

## Milestone 2

In this milestone you will allow the user to play repeated games. After each game, your program should prompt the to enter **1** to continue and **0** quit.

When the user quits, the program should print a summary of how many games were played, how many games the player won, and what percentage of games the player won (to two decimal places.)

Example run showing 3 games (user input in **bold**):

<pre>
Which door would you like to pick? (1-3) <b>1</b>
Monty shows you a goat behind door number 2
Which door would you like to pick now? (1-3) <b>3</b>
You won the car!
Another game? (1=yes, 0=no) <b>1</b>
Which door would you like to pick? (1-3) <b>2</b>
Monty shows you a goat behind door number 3
Which door would you like to pick now? (1-3) <b>1</b>
You won the car!
Another game? (1=yes, 0=no) <b>1</b>
Which door would you like to pick? (1-3) <b>3</b>
Monty shows you a goat behind door number 2
Which door would you like to pick now? (1-3) <b>1</b>
You got a goat, sorry. The car was behind door 3
Another game? (1=yes, 0=no) <b>0</b>
You played 3 games
You won 2 games
You won 66.67% of the games
</pre>

### Deliverables for Milestone 2

There are three deliverables for Milestone 2.

**First deliverable**: The [design artifact](../design-template.pdf) for Milestone 2 is due in class on **Tuesday, Mar 07th**.

**Second deliverable**: Modify the program to allow the player to play multiple times as described above.

You will need to use a loop to allow the game to be repeated. Make sure that statements in your loop are properly indented.

**Third deliverable**: Using your program perform, experiments to test two different strategies for playing the game as follows:

1.  After Monty reveals the goat, stick with your original choice of door
2.  After Monty reveals the goat, switch doors to whichever door Monty did not reveal

For each strategy, play the game 20 times. What percentage of games did you win each time?

Using Notepad++, create an empty document and write a brief summary of your findings. Save it as a file called **experiment.txt** in your **CS101\_Assign02** folder. In the report, indicate what percentage of games you won using each strategy. If one strategy seems to be better, state which one.

Submit your code and report (the second and third deliverables) to Marmoset by running `make submit_ms2`.  They are due by the end of day on **Tuesday, Mar 14th**.

Hints
-----

You can allow your program to generate random integer values as follows.

Add **\#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;** and **\#include &lt;time.h&gt;** to the top of the file (above or below **\#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;**)

The first line of code in your **main** function should be

{% highlight cpp %}
srand(time(0));
{% endhighlight %}

This "seeds" the random number generator to ensure that your program produces a different sequence of random numbers each time it is run.

You can generate a random integer between 1 and 3 with the code

{% highlight cpp %}
int car = (rand() % 3) + 1;
{% endhighlight %}

In this code, "**rand()**" generates a random integer value, "**(rand() % 3)** constrains the random integer to the range 0-2, and adding 1 shifts the range to 1-3. In this code, the generated value is stored in the variable called **car**.

Grading
-------

### Milestone 1

Your grade for milestone 1 will be determined as follows:

-   Completing the design artifact: 10%
-   Choosing a random door that the car is behind: 13%
-   Prompting the user to enter a door, and saving her choice in a variable: 18%
-   Choosing a door for Monty to reveal, printing a message informing the user: 33%
-   Prompting the user to enter a new choice, and saving her choice in a variable: 8%
-   Informing the user whether or not she won the car: 13%
-   Informing the user which door the car was behind: 5%

### Milestone 2

Your grade for milestone 2 will be determined as follows:

-   Completing the design artifact: 10%
